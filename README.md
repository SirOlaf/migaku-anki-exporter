# migaku-anki-exporter
Unofficial Migaku Memory export script

Load it into a manager like Tampermonkey and it should add new buttons on your MM page.

## Exported contents:
- All your deck's cards
- Your review history
- (Optionally) All your deck's media
- (Optionally) Migaku syntax for things like furigana support with the Migaku Anki addon.

The result of the export will be a .apkg file you can import into anki.
